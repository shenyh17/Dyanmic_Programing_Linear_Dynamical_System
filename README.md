# Dynamic programming via linear quadratic regulator problem
When working with numerical computation via dynamic programming, I was dissapointed and dissapointing my advisors that there are not enough materials to support understanding DP principle of calculation to estimate the solution's behavior of differential equation even for the linear case.

Thus, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate simple DP computation and verify the result with a known method of solving discrete-time algebraic Reccati equation. Instead of direct calculate solution for Reccati equation, we will also find it recursively to gain better understanding of the linear quadratic regulator problem in control theory.

Problem formulation and process: see this [notebook](https://github.com/tnaduc/Linear_quadratic_regulator/blob/master/DP_1.ipynb)
